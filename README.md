# Quiz-App

This project was realized with the aim of learning Agile Project Management and to build an Quiz App inspired by the classic game "Higher or Lower".

## How does it work?


```
The aim of the game is to guess the randomly selected number between two given numbers. 
You do this by entering an number and the computer answers with “higher” if the number you entered is higher than the randomized number or “lower” if the given number is lower than the randomized number.
When you start the game, you get a choice of how many and which bots you want to battle against. As well as a short description about how each of the bots work.
In 'Settings' you also have the option to make the game more difficult by not updating the number range. Good luck!
